# AutoWord vNext - Known Issues and Limitations

## Overview

This document catalogs known edge cases, limitations, and uncovered scenarios in the AutoWord vNext pipeline. These issues represent areas where the current implementation may not handle all possible document variations or where manual intervention might be required.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Complex Table Structures

**Issue**: Tables with merged cells, nested tables, or complex formatting may not be properly handled during section deletion.

**Symptoms**:
- Section boundaries incorrectly identified when headings span merged cells
- Nested table content not properly preserved during deletion
- Table formatting lost after style rule application

**Workaround**: 
- Manually verify table structure before processing
- Use `clear_direct_formatting` with explicit authorization for complex tables
- Consider splitting complex tables before processing

**Tracking**: High priority for future enhancement

### 2. Cross-Reference Integrity

**Issue**: Cross-references to deleted sections may become broken links after section deletion.

**Symptoms**:
- "Error! Reference source not found" messages
- Broken internal hyperlinks
- Invalid bookmark references

**Workaround**:
- Run Fields.Update() after processing (automatically done)
- Manually review and fix broken references
- Consider using `reassign_paragraphs_to_style` to update reference styles

**Tracking**: Medium priority - requires cross-reference mapping enhancement

### 3. Multi-Language Document Handling

**Issue**: Documents with mixed languages (Chinese/English/other) may have inconsistent font application.

**Symptoms**:
- Font fallbacks not applied correctly to non-CJK text
- Style aliases not working for non-Chinese style names
- Inconsistent line spacing in mixed-language paragraphs

**Workaround**:
- Use explicit font specifications for both east_asian and latin fonts
- Test font availability before processing
- Consider separate style rules for different language sections

**Tracking**: Medium priority - requires enhanced localization support

## Moderate Issues

### 4. Large Document Performance

**Issue**: Very large documents (>100 pages, >10MB) may experience performance degradation or timeout issues.

**Symptoms**:
- Processing timeout after 300 seconds
- Memory usage spikes during extraction
- COM automation becomes unresponsive

**Workaround**:
- Increase timeout settings in pipeline.json
- Process documents in smaller sections
- Close other Word instances before processing

**Tracking**: Low priority - optimization needed for enterprise use

### 5. Protected Document Elements

**Issue**: Password-protected sections, restricted editing areas, or locked content controls cannot be modified.

**Symptoms**:
- Operations fail silently on protected content
- Partial processing results
- Access denied errors in audit logs

**Workaround**:
- Remove protection before processing
- Use document inspection to identify protected areas
- Process unprotected sections only

**Tracking**: Low priority - requires protection detection

### 6. Custom Style Inheritance

**Issue**: Complex style inheritance chains may not be properly preserved during style rule modifications.

**Symptoms**:
- Child styles not updating when parent styles change
- Unexpected formatting changes in derived styles
- Style hierarchy corruption

**Workaround**:
- Apply style rules to all levels of hierarchy
- Use `clear_direct_formatting` to reset inheritance
- Manually verify style relationships after processing

**Tracking**: Medium priority - requires style dependency analysis

## Minor Issues

### 7. Revision Tracking Edge Cases

**Issue**: Documents with complex revision histories may not handle all track changes scenarios.

**Symptoms**:
- Some revisions not properly accepted/rejected
- Revision metadata inconsistencies
- Unexpected content in final document

**Workaround**:
- Accept/reject all changes before processing
- Use revision handling configuration options
- Manual review of revision-heavy documents

**Tracking**: Low priority - covers most common scenarios

### 8. Field Code Variations

**Issue**: Non-standard field codes or custom field implementations may not be recognized.

**Symptoms**:
- Fields not updated during processing
- Custom field content lost
- Field type misidentification

**Workaround**:
- Use standard Word field codes only
- Convert custom fields to standard equivalents
- Manual field verification after processing

**Tracking**: Low priority - standard fields well supported

### 9. Font Embedding and Licensing

**Issue**: Embedded fonts or licensed fonts may not be available on processing system.

**Symptoms**:
- Font fallback warnings even when fonts appear available
- Licensing restrictions prevent font usage
- Embedded font extraction failures

**Workaround**:
- Install required fonts on processing system
- Use system fonts in fallback chains
- Verify font licensing for automated processing

**Tracking**: Low priority - system configuration issue

## Unsupported Scenarios

### 10. Real-Time Collaborative Documents

**Issue**: Documents being actively edited in real-time collaboration are not supported.

**Recommendation**: Process offline copies only.

### 11. Macro-Enabled Documents

**Issue**: Documents with VBA macros may have unpredictable behavior.

**Recommendation**: Remove macros before processing or use macro-free versions.

### 12. Non-Standard Document Formats

**Issue**: Documents created by non-Microsoft applications may have compatibility issues.

**Recommendation**: Save as standard DOCX format in Microsoft Word before processing.

### 13. Extremely Complex Layouts

**Issue**: Documents with complex multi-column layouts, text boxes, or advanced positioning may not preserve layout integrity.

**Recommendation**: Simplify layout before processing or accept potential layout changes.

## Reporting New Issues

### Issue Classification

**Critical**: Causes data loss, corruption, or system failure
**Moderate**: Causes incorrect results or significant usability problems  
**Minor**: Causes cosmetic issues or minor inconveniences

### Required Information

1. Document characteristics (size, complexity, source application)
2. User intent and expected behavior
3. Actual behavior and error messages
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Sample document (if possible to share)
6. System configuration (Word version, OS, fonts installed)

### Escalation Process

1. Check this document for known workarounds
2. Test with simplified document to isolate issue
3. Gather required information
4. Submit issue with classification and details
5. Implement workaround if available while awaiting fix

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Enhanced Table Handling**: Better support for complex table structures
2. **Cross-Reference Management**: Automatic reference updating and validation
3. **Performance Optimization**: Streaming processing for large documents
4. **Advanced Localization**: Multi-language document support
5. **Protection Detection**: Identify and handle protected document elements

### Research Areas

1. **AI-Assisted Layout Preservation**: Machine learning for layout integrity
2. **Advanced Style Analysis**: Deep style dependency mapping
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Support for collaborative document processing
4. **Format Conversion**: Enhanced compatibility with non-Microsoft formats
