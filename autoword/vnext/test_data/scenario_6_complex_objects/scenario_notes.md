# Scenario 6: Complex Objects Preservation

## Test Objective
Verify that the pipeline correctly preserves complex document objects (formulas, content controls, charts, SmartArt) through the inventory system during processing.

## Document Characteristics
- Contains mathematical formulas and equations
- Includes content controls (dropdown lists, date pickers, text boxes)
- Has embedded charts and SmartArt graphics
- May include OLE objects and embedded files
- Tests inventory.full.v1.json storage and preservation

## Expected Behavior
1. Extract structure with complex objects identified
2. Store complex objects in inventory.full.v1.json as OOXML fragments
3. Generate plan for standard operations (deletion + style standardization)
4. Execute operations while preserving complex objects
5. Validate that complex objects remain functional
6. Ensure inventory references maintain object integrity

## Validation Points
- All complex objects preserved and functional after processing
- inventory.full.v1.json contains proper OOXML fragments
- Object references remain valid after document modification
- Charts and SmartArt maintain data connections
- Content controls retain functionality and validation rules
- Mathematical formulas display and calculate correctly

## Edge Cases Covered
- Formula preservation during section deletion
- Content control integrity across style changes
- Chart data source preservation
- SmartArt layout and formatting retention
- OLE object embedding maintenance
- Cross-references to complex objects
