# Scenario 7: Revision Tracking Handling

## Test Objective
Verify that the pipeline correctly handles documents with track changes and revision history according to configured revision strategy.

## Document Characteristics
- Contains tracked changes (insertions, deletions, formatting changes)
- Has revision history with multiple authors and timestamps
- May include comments and review annotations
- Tests different revision handling strategies
- Verifies revision metadata preservation or cleanup

## Expected Behavior
1. Detect revision tracking status during extraction
2. Apply configured revision strategy:
   - **Accept**: Accept all changes before processing
   - **Reject**: Reject all changes before processing  
   - **Bypass**: Process with revisions intact (advanced mode)
3. Generate standard plan for document operations
4. Execute operations with revision handling
5. Validate final document revision state
6. Log revision handling actions to warnings.log

## Validation Points
- Revision strategy correctly applied before processing
- Document content reflects chosen revision handling
- No revision artifacts in final document (accept/reject modes)
- Revision metadata handled appropriately
- Comments and annotations preserved or removed as configured
- warnings.log contains revision handling notifications

## Edge Cases Covered
- Multiple revision authors and timestamps
- Complex revision overlaps and conflicts
- Revision tracking in deleted sections
- Comment preservation during section deletion
- Revision metadata consistency
- Track changes state after processing

## Configuration Options
```json
{
  "revision_strategy": "accept|reject|bypass",
  "preserve_comments": true|false,
  "preserve_revision_metadata": true|false,
  "log_revision_actions": true|false
}
```
