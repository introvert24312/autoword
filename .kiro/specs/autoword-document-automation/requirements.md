# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AutoWord is a Windows-based document automation tool that transforms Word document comments into executable tasks using LLM technology. The system reads .docx files, extracts comments and document structure, generates structured task lists via LLM, and executes document modifications through Word COM automation while preserving formatting integrity and maintaining document structure consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want to load Word documents and extract their structure and comments, so that I can prepare them for automated processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a .docx file THEN the system SHALL open the document using Word COM
2. WHEN the document is loaded THEN the system SHALL extract all comments with their IDs, authors, page numbers, and anchor text
3. WHEN the document is loaded THEN the system SHALL capture the document structure including headings, styles, TOC, hyperlinks, and references
4. WHEN the document is loaded THEN the system SHALL create a backup copy before any modifications
5. WHEN the document has track changes enabled THEN the system SHALL disable revision tracking before processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want the system to generate structured task plans from comments, so that I can review and execute document modifications systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document structure and comments are extracted THEN the system SHALL send them to LLM with structured prompts
2. WHEN LLM processes the input THEN the system SHALL receive tasks in valid JSON format matching the defined schema
3. WHEN tasks are generated THEN the system SHALL validate each task against formatting constraints
4. WHEN tasks involve formatting changes THEN the system SHALL require explicit comment authorization
5. WHEN tasks are validated THEN the system SHALL sort them by dependencies and risk levels
6. IF LLM context limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to chunked processing with final global review

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want to execute document modifications safely through Word COM, so that I can apply changes while maintaining document integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing tasks THEN the system SHALL use Word COM Range/Bookmark APIs for precise positioning
2. WHEN executing formatting tasks THEN the system SHALL verify comment authorization before proceeding
3. WHEN executing tasks THEN the system SHALL follow the order: content → structure → references → styles → pagination → TOC/links
4. WHEN a task fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining tasks
5. WHEN high-risk tasks are identified THEN the system SHALL perform dry-run validation first
6. WHEN all content tasks complete THEN the system SHALL refresh TOC page numbers and validate hyperlinks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want strict formatting protection controls, so that document formatting is only changed when explicitly requested in comments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating tasks THEN the system SHALL include hard constraints against unauthorized formatting changes in LLM prompts
2. WHEN planning tasks THEN the system SHALL filter out formatting tasks without corresponding comment IDs
3. WHEN executing tasks THEN the system SHALL block formatting operations that lack comment authorization
4. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL validate no unauthorized formatting changes occurred
5. IF unauthorized formatting changes are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically revert to backup and log violations
6. WHEN content-only operations are performed THEN the system SHALL allow rewrite/insert/delete without comment requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want proper TOC and hyperlink management, so that document navigation remains functional after modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL prioritize heading-style based TOC generation
2. WHEN updating TOC THEN the system SHALL maintain 1-3 heading levels without skipping levels
3. WHEN processing internal links THEN the system SHALL prefer heading anchors over bookmarks
4. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL update TOC page numbers and validate hyperlink targets
5. IF TOC becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL delete and rebuild with standard parameters
6. WHEN rebuilding TOC THEN the system SHALL include hyperlinks and right-aligned page numbers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want a modern Windows GUI interface, so that I can easily manage the document automation workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a modern UI using PySide6 with Fluent design
2. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL provide Files, Inspect, Plan, Run, and Review sections
3. WHEN in Files section THEN the system SHALL allow document selection, show metadata, and manage backups
4. WHEN in Inspect section THEN the system SHALL display comments in a filterable table with anchor excerpts
5. WHEN in Plan section THEN the system SHALL show task tree with dependencies, risks, and enable/disable controls
6. WHEN in Run section THEN the system SHALL display progress bars, real-time logs, and pause/abort controls
7. WHEN in Review section THEN the system SHALL show TOC changes, link validation results, and export options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want comprehensive logging and reporting, so that I can track changes and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are generated THEN the system SHALL save plan.json with the complete task list
2. WHEN tasks execute THEN the system SHALL log each task's status, timing, and any errors to run_log.json
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate diff.md showing paragraph, heading, and TOC changes
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL NOT record API keys or complete document content
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with context for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want reliable LLM integration with fallback options, so that task generation remains available even with API issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling LLM services THEN the system SHALL support both GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 through OpenAI-compatible endpoints
2. WHEN LLM returns invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL retry with explicit JSON format requirements
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest alternative models
4. WHEN using LLM services THEN the system SHALL read API keys from environment variables securely
5. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL handle context limits gracefully with chunking fallback

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want the system to run reliably on Windows 10 with Word installed, so that I can use it in my standard work environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the application THEN the system SHALL require Python 3.10+, Windows 10, and Microsoft Word
2. WHEN running COM operations THEN the system SHALL use single-threaded execution with proper COM initialization
3. WHEN packaging the application THEN the system SHALL include all required dependencies and resources
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify Word COM availability and display appropriate errors if missing
5. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL handle Word COM exceptions gracefully and provide recovery options
